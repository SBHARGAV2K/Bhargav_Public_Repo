This repository contains my prominent works in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, and Python programming.

Each project is structured as follows:-

1. There is a file of format **project_name.py**, which contains a class of all the methods used in the project.

2. In the **main.py**, the code to execute the project and obtain the output is written.
