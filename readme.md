This repository contains my prominent works in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, and Python programming.

Each project is structured as follows:-

1. There is a file named in the format **project_name.py**, which contains a class of all the methods used in the project.

2. In the **main.py**, the code to execute the project and obtain the output is written.

The description of each project is shown below:-

i) __doctrOCR__: To detect, extract and store text obtained from image-based PDFs using the in-built docTR OCR module; To make use of this module for your project, make sure that the following modules are installed:-

>!pip install python-doctr

>!pip install "python-doctr[tf]"

>!pip install "python-doctr[torch]"

ii) 

The methods and classes in each project are designed using Sphonx docstring format, and the codes follow PEP8 style guidelines.
