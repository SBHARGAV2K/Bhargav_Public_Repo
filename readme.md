This repository contains my prominent works in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, and Python programming.

Each project is structured as follows:-

    * There is a __project_name.py__ which contains a class of all the methods used in the project.

    * In the __main.py__, the code to execute the project and obtain the output is written.
